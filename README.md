# Java_RMI_object_passing
Implement a type of remote object (PrintService) that exposes a method to the *PrintService* interface to remotely print (on the standard output) the content of a *Person* object passed as an argument to the *print()* method. The Person class should have the *firstName*, *lastName*, and *age* instance variables, the related constructors, and get and set methods. Implement a variant of the client that sends an instance of Person to the server by invoking the *print()* method.
